# Review - Conditionals

NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

1. Save a random whole number between -10 and 10 to a variable.
2. If that variable is greater than 0, print "Ye" and otherwise print "No"
3. If that variable is greater than 5, print "Winner", otherwise if that variable is greather than 0, print "OK", otherwise print "Try again!"
4. Save another random number between -10 and 10 to a variable.
5. If both variables are more than 5, print "Good scores!"
6. If either variable is below -9, print "Minus nine!"
7. Create a variable to store a message. If your random numbers added together is smaller than zero, save the message "We have gone sub zero!". Otherwise, set the message to null.
